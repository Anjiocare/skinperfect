                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Ringworm is a common fungal skin infection that, while not life-threatening, can be persistent, itchy, and uncomfortable. The visible rashes often cause embarrassment, especially when the infection affects sensitive areas such as the inner thighs, groin, buttocks, or face. Early and appropriate treatment is essential to prevent spreading and recurring infections.</p>
                        <p>Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment by a qualified dermatologist play a key role in managing ringworm effectively and preventing complications.</p>

                        <h4>What Is Ringworm and What Cures It?</h4>
                        <p>Despite its name, ringworm is not caused by a worm. It is a fungal infection known as dermatophytosis, caused by dermatophyte fungi. These fungi thrive in warm, moist areas of the body such as the groin, underarms, inner thighs, and feet. Ringworm spreads easily through skin-to-skin contact or by sharing contaminated items like towels, clothes, combs, or bedsheets.<br>  
                        The most effective way to cure ringworm is through antifungal treatment, which includes topical creams and, in moderate to severe cases, oral antifungal medications. Complete cure also depends on maintaining good hygiene, avoiding reinfection, and finishing the full course of treatment—even if symptoms improve early.</p>
                        <p>Consistent treatment and proper skin care are essential to prevent recurrence</p>

                        <p>Ringworm is caused by dermatophyte fungi that infect the skin, hair, or nails. The infection spreads through direct contact with an infected person or indirectly through contaminated objects such as towels, bedsheets, clothing, or combs. Excessive sweating, moisture, poor hygiene, and hot, humid environments increase the risk of infection and its spread.</p>

                    <p>A traditional neck lift incision often begins in the hairline at the level of the sideburn,
                        continues down and around the ear and ends in the posterior hair. Fat may be sculpted or
                        redistributed from the jowls and neck. The tissue underlying the neck skin is repositioned,
                        and commonly the platysma muscle is tightened. Skin is redraped over the uplifted contours
                        and excess skin is trimmed away. A separate incision under the chin is often necessary for
                        liposuction of this area and for repair of the muscle. Sutures or skin adhesives close the
                    incisions.</p>
